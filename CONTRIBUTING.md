# Contributing

### Did you find a bug?
- If it is security related, please contact me via E-Mail or LinkedIn (visible on my profile). Do not open an issue.

Please verify that the issue has not been reported already, by searching under [Issues](https://github.com/NathanThus/Animated-Text/issues).

If it has not been reported, open an new [issue](https://github.com/NathanThus/Animated-Text/issues/new), and fill in the form. 

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

Open a PR, outlining the bug, and preferably include the issue number using the [closing](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) keyword.

### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

This will most likely not be accepted. Contributions should focus on improving stability, performance and extendibility for the end-user.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

Suggest your change by creating an issue in [Issues](https://github.com/NathanThus/Animated-Text/issues) and mention the code owner(s).

If it is deemed valuable to the code base, fork the repository and open a branch. Implenent the change, and await review.

### **Do you intend to improve the documentation?**

Please open an issue, describing the problem with the documentation. Once it has been verified, feel free to create a branch.

Thank you for your contribution in advance! :heart:
